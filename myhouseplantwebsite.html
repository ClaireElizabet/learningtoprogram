			<h2 id="Intro">We shall start at the beginning</h2>
		<p>
			In August 2017 I was lucky enough to be able to buy my first house in London. I was very excited but sadly all was not well in my new abode.
			I feel victim to a terrible tradesman who broke my electric supply and left me in the dark without power for 5 days. In my sadness at being
			without power I decided to go home to visit my parents and get some TLC (tender loving care). <br>
			I should add at this point that my parents both love gardening, I grew up in a very green home but had lost touch with my roots (pardon the pun) since leaving home 10 years previous.
		</p>
		<p>
			The weekend with my parents was just what I needed after my crazy week in the flat and I was sent back to London with a two money plant cuttings and a promise that things would get better.
			This was the beginning.

		<h2 id="Next">Now let's go to what happened next</h2>
		<p>
			What did happen next? Well the next thing was triggered by a phone call from my friend Becky. Becky is probably my most grown up friend. We went to school together and moved to London
			about the same time. She had begun her journey on the property ladder a few years ago and by the time I entered this world, had become totally indoctrenated into the interior design
			set. "Claire! Now you finally have your flat we absolutely <b><em>HAVE</em></b> to go shopping for accessories!" I admit I was excited to get decorating so agreed to spend the next Saturday with her doing <em>"house stuff"</em>.
		</p>
		<p>After a day long tour of her favourite stores and significantly poorer than when we began she dropped me back at the flat and we sat down for a cup of tea. &#x2615; Suddenly Becky looked up at me from her phone and said - "Where exactly are we again?". "Nunhead" I replied.
			<br>"I knew I recognised it!" exclaimed Becky, "You know we're right next to the Nunhead Gardener? I've always wanted to go. It closes at 6, do you mind?". I did not mind so we hopped back into the car and drove up the hill to the Nunhead Gardener, a hipster garden centre
			apparently very close to my flat.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was what happened next. I entered the beautiful plant filled building and returned home with 7 tiny cacti to add to my collection.

			<h2 id="Building">The collection builds</h2>
			<p>
				Over the next few months several things happened.
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>My long term boyfriend moved in</li>
					<li>The great freeze of November 2017 (we had no heating)</li>
					<li>My long term boyfriend developed the "electric heater duel cyclone heating system"</li>
					<li>I finally visited Cuba!</li>
				</ul>
			But most importantly my houseplant collection grew and grew*.
			<br><br>Why is this so important I hear you ask? Well I am from the countryside but live in a big city. I have always felt since leaving the country that I am somewhat disconnected from nature and it's calming influence. This has started to change since I begun my collection.
			I'm not ashamed to say my house plants are like my children. I talk to them and truely love them (though this may not be obvious from the number of unexplained deaths). I definitely recommend that everyone gets a couple of plants as they will really help your wellbeing.
			<br><br>*with the exception of the terrible drought of December. It occured without our knowledge whilst we were in Cuba and sadly killed off 50% of the group... &#x2639;

			<h2 id="Moving">Moving forward</h2>
			<p>
				Moving forward for 2018 - what will I do? Well I still have several pots and areas that could hold a plant. I have also bought several packets of seeds to grow herbs on my kitchen windowsil - I'm very excited to see if I can get them to grow and then make meals with them.
				When summer comes I plan on getting a 'balcony greenhouse'. These are plastic strucures with several shelves which I can use to house the crop of vegetables I plan on cultivating this year.
				<br>Next weekend I will be going back home to visit my parents and plan on speaking with my dad about which I should plant and when will be the best time. He is an expert at growing delicious crops! I know I want to grow tomatoes as I love fresh tomatoes in summer but am hoping I can also grow some more interesting or rare things.
			</p>
			<p>I hope that reading this will inspire you to grow more plants. I have listed my current plants (that haven't died) or ones that are on my wishlist to inspire you! I highly recommend naming them to help them grow happily.
